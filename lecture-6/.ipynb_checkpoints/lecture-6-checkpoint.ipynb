    "We looked at machine learning as a general practice of creating mathematical/statistical/algorithmic models out of data in order to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "![model](images/model.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various ways we can group machine learning methods. The most obvious one is *supervised* vs *unsupervised* learning methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Different Learning Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supervised learning\n",
    "\n",
    "We have examples of input-output pairs.  Examples: OLS regression, k-nn and naive Bayes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unsupervised learning\n",
    "\n",
    "There are no input output pairs and the model is generated by looking at the internal structure of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Models\n",
    "\n",
    "One can classify the types of models each learning method into two main classes: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Parametric: Model is determined by specific values called *parameter*. \n",
    "  * OLS regression: the parameters are $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ where $y \\sim \\alpha x + \\beta$\n",
    "  * k-means: the parameters are cluster centers.\n",
    "  * naive Bayes: the parameters are apriori probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Non-parametric: Model is a monolithic(no parts) blackbox algorithm:\n",
    "  * k-nn\n",
    "  * neural networks\n",
    "  \n",
    "## Model building process\n",
    "\n",
    "The general method of building **parametric** models can be described by the diagram below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![build](images/build.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "* For OLS regression models the *cost* function was:\n",
    "$$ RSS(\\alpha,\\beta) = \\sum_i (\\alpha x_i + \\beta - y_i)^2 $$\n",
    "* For k-means the cost function was\n",
    "$$ KM(f,c_1,\\ldots,c_k) = \\sum_j d(c_{f(j)},x_j) $$\n",
    "where $f\\colon D\\to \\{1,\\ldots,k\\}$ is the labelling function and $c_1,\\ldots,c_k$ are the cluster centers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonparametric models do something else.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Numeric vs Categorical Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "One factor that determines the type of the model and the type of the learning method we use is the type of the dependent or independent variables\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numerical variables\n",
    "\n",
    "A numeric variable is a number. These come from measurements such as \n",
    "\n",
    "* length, \n",
    "* count, \n",
    "* weight, \n",
    "* electric charge etc.\n"
